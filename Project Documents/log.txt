Meeting with Client, January 29, 2025

Reason for meeting again: Discuss the vision statement and the big user stories. 

Vision statement summary: Study Buddies is a system designed to help York University students create and manage study groups, offering features like group chats with read receipts, polls, and reporting functions to ensure a safe environment. It provides scheduling tools for courses, office hours, and study sessions, along with resource-sharing capabilities that are monitored for accuracy. The platform also enables students to book study rooms, authenticate York University users for security, and track its success through usage metrics and student satisfaction surveys. By fostering collaboration, Study Buddies aims to improve student connections and promote effective group studying.

Big user stories:  User Stories
Revisiting how room booking is done: Last we discussed, we aren’t able to get information on which rooms are empty and at what time, and the only possible way of getting such information would be through web scraping. 
Collaborate with the IT department to allow students to book rooms or make a study group for pre-reserved rooms. 
Revisiting our conversation on chat integration: Our own chat with safeguards. What do you think? Helps us tackle more features for our project requirement. 

Summarize all the points discussed above in 5 minutes (Wrap up): 
Go through a revised vision statement. 
Go through the revised user stories

Updates:
    Deadline next Friday the 14th.
    Create your branch like this: name-iter0 (ex. abdullah-iter0)
    Start on your individual features on your branches, we'll figure integration of all the parts later.
    Don't worry about design (UI), we'll figure it out next iteration.
    Ask for help if you don't understand something, but use AI models and forums to get a solution before asking.
    We will use 2 test user accounts to work with (still needs to be created)
    Besides every feature in the #iteration-features channel, we just have to create 2 test accounts.
